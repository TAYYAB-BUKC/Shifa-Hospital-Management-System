# Shifa-Hospital-Management-System
The Shifa Hospital Management System is designed for any hospital to replace their existing manual paper based system. The project Shifa Hospital Management system includes registration of patients, storing their details into the system, and also computerized billing in the pharmacy, and labs. The purpose of the project entitled as “SHIFA HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is to computerize the Front Office Management of Hospital to develop software which is user friendly simple, fast, and cost – effective. The new system is to control the information of patients. Room availability, staff and operating room schedules and patient invoices. We have designed the given proposed system using C# to automate the process of day to day activities of Hospital like Room activities, Admission of New Patient, Discharge of Patient, assign a Doctor, and finally compute the bill etc. All the control is under the administrator and the other members have the rights to just see perform transactions of their related interests. These services are to be provided in an efficient, cost effective manner, with the goal of reducing the time and resources currently required for such tasks.
